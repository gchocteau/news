Hello,

Sorry for my simple question but I do not succeed in refreshing feeds under news ! 

Config : OC 5.0.10
News : 1.205
TAL : 0.2.2

I think my web host does not want... Or my web host product ! Or maybe God himself ! :-)

Neverminds...

What about creating a simply "refresh button" I can push when I want to refresh my feeds. I do not need cron or automatic process...

Silly proposal ? So difficult ? Si silly ? So strange ?

Thanks for answer

Guillaume

As you can read, I am french... So, be educational (??) in your answer please
